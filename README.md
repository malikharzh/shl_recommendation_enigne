SHL Assessment Recommendation Engine

This project provides intelligent SHL assessment recommendations based on natural language queries such as job descriptions or skill requirements. It combines a semantic search backend powered by SentenceTransformers with an interactive Gradio-based frontend interface.

The system is deployed across two services:

Frontend: Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, offering a user-friendly interface for recruiters and hiring managers.
Backend API: Hosted via Railway, supporting JSON-based recommendations programmatically.
Key Features
Accepts free-text input (e.g., job role, skillset).
Uses semantic embedding and cosine similarity to find relevant SHL assessments.
Powered by all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from the SentenceTransformers library.
API with /health for status check and /recommend for JSON responses.
Frontend displays results in a clickable, tabular interface using Gradio Blocks.
